# CHIP8-Ahoy
Yet another CHIP-8 emulator written in C++/Raylib.

## Run
`> CHIP8-Ahoy.exe <display_scale> <ROM>`  

Example: `> CHIP8-Ahoy.exe 20 ROM/Pong.ch8`  
  
Display scale is how big you want your window to be, CHIP-8 is only 64 by 32 pixels.  
ROM is the path to your .ch8 file.

## Build
It's a Visual Studio project, just build it.
